# ðŸ”¬SMB Enum

**`SMB`** (**S**erver **M**essage **B**lock) - a network file and resource sharing protocol, based on a _client-server_ model.

There are many variants of the SMB protocol like SMBv1, CIFS, SMBv2, SMBv2.1, SMBv3, and so on.

- `e.g.` Windows mapping and sharing drives as letter, uses SMB

Usually SMB can be found on ports **`139`** or **`445`** and `nmap` service and scripts enumeration (`-sV`, `-sC`) can find more info about the O.S. version.

After finding SMB through port scanning, gather more information with `nmap`.

```bash
sudo nmap -p445 -sV -sC -O <TARGET_IP>
```
